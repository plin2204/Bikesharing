# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 

This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Questions: What is the Population and Gender diversity of Des Moines? What effects do them have on possible business in Des Moines? 

According to US Census Bureau, Des Moines (216,183) has only **1/10** population than NYC bike record (2,344,224), 
so the market will be much smaller. <br>

Also female uses are ~1/3 of male users based on the Gerder Breakdown of NYC Bike Analysis, so the total expected ratio is 1/6(female) + 1/2(male) = **2/3**.

Among Des Moines population, it is roughly **60%** between 20 and 60 years old, since most users from NYC are between 20 and 60 years old.
### The market expectation is 1/10 * 2/3 * 6/10 = **4/100** of NYC!


## Conclusion:

The investment scale in Des Moines should be NO more than **4%** of NYC.
After all, Des Moines couldn't have as many tourists as New York!
